## About

Hi, I'm Bruno. I'm a software developer in [Grenoble, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenoble) and I've been building software for over seven years. I really like Python and Java, and Linux is my OS of choice.  

I have a degree in Automation and Industrial Computing with a study focus on [Embeded System](https://iut1.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/formation/licence-professionnelle-automatique-et-informatique-industrielle-specialite-systemes-embarques) from [Grenoble university](https://iut1.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr). I've worked with a lot of languages (C, C#, Python, Java) on Windows, Linux or stand-alone microcontrollers. I'm currently software developper for the french leader in automatic toll systems, GEA.

In my free time, I realy enjoy a motorbike riding or sharing a beer with friends after some team sports or not.
