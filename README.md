## About

Hi, I'm Bruno ZANARDI. I'm a software developer in Grenoble, France and I've been building software for over seven years. I really like Python and Java, and Linux is my OS of choice.  

I have a degree in Automation and Industrial Computing with a study focus on Embeded System from Grenoble university. I've worked with a lot of language (C, C#, Python, Java) on Windows, Linux or stand-alone microcontrollers. I'm currently software developper for the french leader in automatic toll systems, GEA.

In my free time, I realy enjoy a motorbike riding or sharing a beer with friends after some team sports or not.
