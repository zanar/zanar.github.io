There is a lot of reasons to want to / have to show what append in commit logs. So remember, commit logs is at least as important as source codes.

There is a git command to show commit logs. Without any options, it will show you all parents commit of your current version: `git log`

{% include terminal.html cmds="log_1" %}

If you activated `log.abbrevCommit` in your configuration, the output will be:

{% include terminal.html cmds="log_2" %}

There is a lot of options with `log` (more than a hundred!), to filter them before display or show more informations about each commits.
If you defined the `hist` alias like me, you will be able to see:

{% include terminal.html cmds="hist_1" %}
