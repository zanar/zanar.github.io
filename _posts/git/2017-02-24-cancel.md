In this post, you will learn how to cancel files modifications, before or after staging them.

### After staging

Current repository state:

{% include terminal.html cmds="status_6" %}

Did you noticed? `status` output tell us how to do and we'll follow the tip:

{% include terminal.html cmds="reset_1|status_7" %}

we also can do:

{% include terminal.html cmds="reset_2|status_8" %}

or, obviously:

{% include terminal.html cmds="reset_3|status_9" %}

### Before staging

... or after removed from index  
  
This time, the repository state is:

{% include terminal.html cmds="status_9" %}

Again, let's use the tip:

{% include terminal.html cmds="checkout_1|status_10" %}

for multiple files:

{% include terminal.html cmds="checkout_2|status_11" %}

or for all files:

{% include terminal.html cmds="checkout_3|status_3" %}

It's wierd but also obvious to use `checkout`: somewhere, undo changes is a "navigation" to the last commit.
