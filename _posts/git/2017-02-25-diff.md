`diff` is a powerfull and usefull tool. It can show you changes in files, between commits or branches, and many other!

Let's start with the beginning:

{% include terminal.html cmds="diff_2" %}

This simple command will show you differences between working directory and index.  
By adding the `--cached` option, the output will be the differences between index and last commit.  
And the `HEAD` option extract differences between the last commit and the working directory.

Then, if you specify a file or a directory:

{% include terminal.html cmds="diff_3" %}

The output will be limited to the file or the directory and will be made between the same origins than previously. You can also add `--cached` or `HEAD` option.

You can specify two commits to compare:

{% include terminal.html cmds="diff_4" %}

to show differences bewteen them. The **..** between <hash_1> and <hash_2> is very important.

Finnally, a last option: `--stat`. The output will be:

{% include terminal.html cmds="diff_1" %}
