### Create a patch

You cloned a git repository, modified the source code, made some commits and for a reason or an other you can't / don't want to push them but you want to share them with the project maintainer? Build a patch and send it to him (or her) by email!

The basic command is `git format-patch`, and here is the options you can use.

#### You know how much commits you want to share

{% include terminal.html cmds="patch_1" %}

Replace `{x}` by the number of commits. Git will create a patch which contains the `{x}` last commits starting from `HEAD` included.

#### You know your first commit hash

{% include terminal.html cmds="patch_2" %}

Git will create a patch which contains all the commits since the parent (excluded) of your first commit

#### You did your commits in a branch

{% include terminal.html cmds="patch_3" %}

Git will create a patch which contains all the commits since your branch start.

These three commands will create a file in the current directory you can send to the project maintainer.

### Check a patch

You created a patch or you received a patch by mail, and you want to check it before sending / apply it?

Run this command:

{% include terminal.html cmds="apply_1" %}

It will show you the same output than `git diff --stat`.

You also can check if this patch is applicable to your working directory? Also use `git apply` command, but with the `--check` option:

{% include terminal.html cmds="apply_2" %}

It will tell you if you will be able to apply the patch without conflicts.

### Apply a patch

Yes, we can use `apply` to apply the patch, but we won't. Instead, we'll use `am`. Why? Because `am` has the `--signoff` option which will put the name and the email of the patch maker in the commit identification.

{% include terminal.html cmds="am_1" %}

The `-k` option is used to keep the text between `[]` in the patch commits messages.
