### Tags

Tagging is usefull to identify versions, branch start or all others ideas you will have.  
  
Put a tag to the current `HEAD` is realy simple:

{% include terminal.html cmds="tag_1" %}

that's it!  
You can also add a message with the tag:

{% include terminal.html cmds="tag_2" %}

  
If you want to delete a tag, it's as easy as create it:

{% include terminal.html cmds="tag_3" %}

And list all tags in a branch is simpler:

{% include terminal.html cmds="tag_4" %}

### Navigation

Now you can easly navigate between tags, start branches or try changes with the next command (branches will be explain in next posts.).

{% include terminal.html cmds="checkout_4" %}

If you configured the `hist` alias as described in the first post, you will be able to see all tags in the output. Usefull, isn't it?

What happend when you use `git checkout`? Let's see a short example. The repository can be described with this "schematic":

            HEAD (refers to 'master')
                |
                v
    a --- b --- c 'master' (refers to c)
          ^
          |
        tag 'v1' (refers to b)

Work in progress, a new commit is added:

    $ edit; git add; git commit;
    
                  HEAD (refers to 'master')
                      |
                      v
    a --- b --- c --- d 'master' (refers to d)
          ^
          |
        tag 'v1' (refers to b)

But something is wrong, or a new idea should be try on 'v1'. Then:

    $ git checkout v1       # or
    $ git checkout b
    
      HEAD (refers to b)
          |
          v
    a --- b --- c --- d 'master' (refers to d)
          ^
          |
        tag 'v1' (refers to b)

You can work exacly as if you where at `HEAD`

    $ edit; git add; git commit;
    
       HEAD (refers to e)
           |
           v
           e
          /
    a --- b --- c --- d 'master' (refers to d)
          ^
          |
        tag 'v1' (refers to b)
    
    $ edit; git add; git commit;
    
             HEAD (refers to f)
                 |
                 v
           e --- f
          /
    a --- b --- c --- d 'master' (refers to d)
          ^
          |
        tag 'v1' (refers to b)

but remember, all your commits (here `e` and `f`) would be lost if you move with `git checkout` to anywhere else. In fact, Git create a "temporary" branch for your new commits.  
To keep the new commits, you can use *when you still are at `f`*:

{% include terminal.html cmds="tag_1" %}

or explicitly create a new branch, as you will learn it soon.
