Now you know basics about git, it's time to share your work with your team and/or the world.

> *Note:*  
> This post will only talk about local / remote without branches. This subject will be discuss in a future post.

### Showing remotes

If you have cloned your repository with `git clone`, you have one remote repository configured. In all cases, to see configured remotes, run:

{% include terminal.html cmds="remote_1" %}

With `-v` option, the command will add urls that Git use for read (`fetch`) and write (`push`) to that remote:

{% include terminal.html cmds="remote_2" %}

### Adding remote repository

`git clone` implicitly add the `origin` remote for you. If you want to add another remote explicitly, use the `remote add` command:

{% include terminal.html cmds="remote_3|remote_4" %}

Now, for all other remote commands, you will be able to use `<shortname>` instead of `<url>`.

### Inspecting remote

It's possible to see some informations about a particular remote. Over `origin`, the command will answer:

{% include terminal.html cmds="remote_5" %}

### Downloading world work

To get datas from your remote repository you can run:

{% include terminal.html cmds="fetch_1" %}

This command will download all remote datas you don't have locally, but without merging them in your local branches.  
Now you can `merge` or `rebase`/`merge` remotes datas into local.  
  
There is a way to do it in one command:

{% include terminal.html cmds="pull_1" %}

Some explainations? Ok: `pull` command without options will do a `fetch` then a `merge`, and the `--rebase=preserve` will ensure you to keep a clean history in complicated merge case.  
By default, `git pull` will do:

{% include terminal.html cmds="fetch_2|merge_1" %}

If the remote branch hasn't move between 2 `pull`, there will be no problems. But if it move, the `merge` will do a *true merge* with a merge commit and keep the remote branch in history and it's not that we want. It's here that the `--rebase` option will save us.  
With the `--rebase=preserve` option, Git make a `rebase` before the `merge`, but will preserve your local branching merge.

There is a configuration variable you can set:

{% include terminal.html cmds="cfg_10" %}

With this configuration, a simple `git pull` will do `git pull --rebase=preserve`.  
You can found more informations about `git pull --rebase` [here](https://delicious-insights.com/en/posts/getting-solid-at-git-rebase-vs-merge/#the-git-pull-and-pull-push-reflex-trap).

### Publishing your work

To send your local work to the remote repository, the command to use is realy simple:

{% include terminal.html cmds="push_2" %}

But sometimes, when you're not up to date locally with remote branch, the `push` will fail:

{% include terminal.html cmds="push_1" %}

Do not use the tip unless you set the `pull.rebase preserve` configuration. If not, use `git pull --rebase=preserve`.  
Then you can do the `push` again.
  
Remember that tags are not pushed automatically. To publish them, use:

{% include terminal.html cmds="push_3" %}


### Renaming / Removing remotes

Like for adding, it's pretty obvious:

{% include terminal.html cmds="remote_6|remote_7" %}
